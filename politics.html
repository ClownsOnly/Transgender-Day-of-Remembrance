                No trans website would be complete without discussing politics. For us in the US, it has been some hard years, with 
                anti-transgender policies and bills on the rise, with much more to come as Donald Trump is to take office once again. 
                It goes without mentioning the rise in anti-transgender violence and suicide that has followed.

                I want you all to stay strong. We have been around for forever and we WILL continue to be around for forever. Nothing they 
                do can extinguish our existence. Please take care of yourselves, you are ALL so important.
