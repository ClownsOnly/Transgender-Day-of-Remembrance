                This page is based on a 
                java program I made during my sophomore year of high school. 
                It was very bare-bones, essentially the skeleton of what would 
                be this page. I hope you truly enjoyed this project of mine, 
                I poured a lot of love and care into it.
                <br><span class="big">Goodbye now!</span>
