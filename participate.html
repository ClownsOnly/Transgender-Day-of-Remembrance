            <ul class="bg-highlight"> You could choose to commemorate their death in a number of ways:
                <li>Educate people around you and online in order to raise awareness to the issues affecting the trans community.</li>
                <li>Create something for TDoR (like me!), whether it be for TDoR in general or for specific person(s).</li>
                <li>Educate yourself on transphobia, systematic discrimination, hate crimes, and intersectionality.</li>
                    <li>Attend TDoR events either online or in person.</li>
                <li>Set up a vigil.</li>
                    or anything else you can think of.
